# 🍽️✨ **FLAVORA** – Smart & Scalable Food Delivery App

Welcome to **FLAVORA**, a modern food delivery solution crafted specially for a **single restaurant** today — but built with scalability in mind to power many more in the future! 🚀  
FLAVORA is designed with simplicity, speed, and real-world usability at its core, making it the perfect choice for single restaurants, cloud kitchens, and beyond. 🌱🍔

Currently, FLAVORA has **two separate Android apps** working together:
